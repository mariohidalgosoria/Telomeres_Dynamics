This directory contains the data set obtained by Yuval Garini's Lab 

Raw trajectories of telomeres in WTC are contined in Sub-directory RWTC, and they are ordered as
 (t,x,y,z)   and labeled in the following way:
For T=50\Delta
LAMT50T2.dat, ....., LAMT50T271.dat  (#270 tracks)
For T=100\Delta 
LAMT100T2.dat, ....., LAMT100T94.dat  (#93 tracks)

The corrected trayectories are stored in the Sub-directory CWTC, 
CCLAT2.dat, ....., CCLAT364.dat (#363 tracks)

with (t,x,y,z) coordinates

Raw trajectories of telomeres in KOC are contined in Sub-directory RKOC, and they are ordered as
 (t,x,y,z)   and labeled in the following way:
For T=50\Delta
 WLAT50T2.dat , ....., WLAT50T60.dat  (#59 tracks)
For T=100\Delta 
WLAT100T2.dat, ....., WLAT100T70.dat  (#69 tracks)

The corrected trayectories are stored in the Sub-directory CKOC, 
CCWLT2.dat, ....., CCWLT129.dat (#128 tracks)

with (t,x,y,z) coordinates
